            ```bash
            ${{ env.POETRY_UPDATED }}
            ```

            ### Outdated dependencies _before_ PR:

            ```bash
            ${{ env.POETRY_OUTDATED_BEFORE }}
            ```

            ### Outdated dependencies _after_ PR:

            ${{ env.POETRY_OUTDATED_AFTER }}
            ```

            _Note: there may be dependencies in the table above which were not updated as part of this PR.
            The reason is they require manual updating due to the way they are pinned._
