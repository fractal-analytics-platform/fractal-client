During the development phase, the latest stable releases of `fractal-server`
and `fractal-client` are always considered as compatible.

The following table shows some additional compatibility constraints for each
`fractal-client` version, which may be useful for working with a
`fractal-server` instance which is not fully up-to-date.

> **WARNING**: This table only shows the `fractal-server`-version lower bounds
> for each `fractal-client` version, but not the corresponding upper bounds.
