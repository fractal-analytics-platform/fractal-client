# Fractal Server

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractal-server.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractal-server)

Fractal is a framework to process high content screening data at scale and prepares it for interactive visualization.

This is the server component of the fractal analytics platform, a framework to
process high content screening data at scale and prepares it for interactive
visualization.

If you are interested in the client component, please refer to the [relevant
repository](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal).

## Installation

You may `pip install fractal-server`. This will install the project and its
dependencies.

### Environment and database

You will need to define some environment variables in order to use
`fractal-server`. For your convenience, you may simply copy
`template.fractal_server.env` to `.fractal_server.env`.

`fractal-server` requires a database to run. Once you set up the environment
variables you need to initialise the database by invoking

```
alembic upgrade
```

## Contributing

To contribute to the development of `fractal-server` you may fork and clone the
[repository](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-server).

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (v1.2) to manage the
development environment and the dependencies. Running

```
poetry install [--with dev]
```

will take care of installing all the dependencies in a separate environment,
optionally installing also the development dependencies.

It may be useful to use a different interpreter from the one installed in your
system. To this end we recommend using
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). In the project folder, invoking

```
pyenv local 3.8.13
poetry env use 3.8
poetry install
```

will install Fractal in a development environment using `python 3.8.13` instad
of the system-wide interpreter.

### Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) for unit and integration
testing of Fractal. If you installed the development dependencies, you may run
the test suite by invoking

```
poetry run pytest
```
