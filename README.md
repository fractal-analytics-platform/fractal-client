Fractal is a framework to process high-content imaging data at scale and prepare it for interactive visualization.

![Fractal_Overview](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/assets/fractal_overview.jpg)

Fractal provides distributed workflows that convert TBs of image data into OME-Zarr files. The platform then processes the 3D image data by applying tasks like illumination correction, maximum intensity projection, 3D segmentation using [cellpose](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and measurements using [napari workflows](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflows). The pyramidal OME-Zarr files enable interactive visualization in the napari viewer.

This is the repository that contains the **Fractal client**. Find more information about Fractal in general and the other repositories at the [Fractal home page](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io).
